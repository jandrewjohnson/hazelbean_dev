## Error Handling Examples

```{python}
import hazelbean as hb, tempfile

# Test with non-existent file
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    p = hb.ProjectFlow(project_dir=tmp)

    # This should work even if file doesn't exist
    try:
        path = p.get_path("missing_file.txt")
        print(f"Resolved path: {path}")
        print("get_path handles missing files gracefully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
```

The above demonstrates how `get_path` handles missing files.
