## üöÄ Quick Start

Ready to begin? Here's how to get the most from these tutorials:

1. **Start with Tutorial 1** - Even experienced users benefit from understanding Hazelbean's project organization
2. **Run code step-by-step** - Don't just read, execute the examples to see results
3. **Experiment freely** - Try modifying parameters and inputs to see how things change
4. **Build progressively** - Each tutorial introduces concepts used in later ones

::: {.callout-tip}
## üí° Learning Tips

- **Keep a notebook** - Jot down insights and questions as you work through examples
- **Use real data** - Once comfortable, try applying concepts to your own datasets  
- **Join the community** - Connect with other Hazelbean users for support and advanced tips
- **Reference documentation** - Use these tutorials alongside the full API documentation

**Time Investment:** Plan about 60-90 minutes total for the complete series, or tackle individual tutorials as needed.
:::

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial series, you will be able to:

- **Initialize and manage** Hazelbean projects with proper organization
- **Load and discover** geospatial data using intelligent file resolution
- **Process and transform** raster data for analysis workflows
- **Conduct spatial analysis** combining multiple datasets effectively
- **Export and organize** results following best practices
- **Apply these patterns** to your own geospatial analysis projects

## üìñ Additional Resources

### Getting Help
- **[Generation Guide](../../examples/README.md)** - How to regenerate and modify these tutorials
