# Hazelbean Testing Infrastructure - Project Presentation

**Prepared for:** Professor Presentation  
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Project:** Comprehensive Testing & Documentation System for Hazelbean Library

---

## Executive Summary

Developed comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Hazelbean geospatial processing library:

- **281 automated tests** (exceeded 200+ target)
- **76% overall pass rate** (214 passing tests)
- **100% smoke test pass rate** (critical infrastructure solid)
- **Live documentation site** with auto-generated content
- **CI/CD quality gates** with performance regression detection

## 1. What We've Built

### Test Coverage by Category

| **Category** | **Tests** | **Pass Rate** | **Status** |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Unit Tests** | 105 | 88% (92 passing) | ✅ Strong |
| **Integration Tests** | 84 | 50% (42 passing) | ⚠️ Data/env issues |
| **Performance Tests** | 69 | 81% (56 passing) | ✅ Good |
| **System/Smoke Tests** | 23 | 100% (23 passing) | ✅ Excellent |
| **TOTAL** | **281** | **77% (216 passing)** | ✅ Solid foundation |

## 2. Live Demo Commands

### Quick Smoke Test (30 seconds)
```bash
conda activate hazelbean_env
python -m pytest hazelbean_tests/system/test_smoke.py -v
```

### Core Unit Tests (2-3 minutes)
```bash
conda activate hazelbean_env
python -m pytest hazelbean_tests/unit/ -v --tb=short
# Shows: 92 passed, 12 xfailed, 1 skipped
```

### Full Test Suite (5 minutes)
```bash
conda activate hazelbean_env
python -m pytest hazelbean_tests/ -v --tb=short
# Shows: 214 passed, 54 failed, 12 xfailed
```

---

## 3. Documentation Site Demo

### Serve Locally
```bash
cd docs-site
conda activate hazelbean_env
mkdocs serve
# Opens at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Generate Fresh Site with Latest Test Results
```bash
conda activate hazelbean_env
./tools/generate_complete_site.sh --serve
# Runs all tests, generates reports, starts server
# Opens at: http://127.0.0.1:8005
```

### Live Site
**URL:** [https://jandrewjohnson.github.io/hazelbean_dev/](https://jandrewjohnson.github.io/hazelbean_dev/)

**What to show:**
- Educational tutorials (progressive learning)
- Auto-generated test documentation
- Live test results with pass/fail metrics
- Performance baselines and benchmarks

## 4. Testing Architecture

### Quality Gate System

```
Gate 1: Smoke Tests (100% pass required)
├── Hazelbean imports
├── ProjectFlow creation
└── Basic environment validation

Gate 2: Unit Tests (Target: 85%+, Current: 86%)
├── get_path resolution (27 tests)
├── tile_iterator operations (14 tests)
└── Core components (64 tests)

Gate 3: Integration Tests (Target: 80%, Current: 50%)
├── Data processing workflows
├── End-to-end scenarios
└── Known issues: GDAL config, missing data files

Gate 4: Performance Regression (Target: <10% slowdown)
├── Baseline stored as GitHub Artifacts
├── PR branches compare against main
└── Auto-blocks PRs >10% slower
```

### Known Bug Tracking with xfail

We use `pytest.mark.xfail` for professional bug tracking:

```python
@pytest.mark.xfail(
    reason="Known bug: project_flow.py:772 - See KNOWN_BUGS.md",
    strict=True,  # Alerts when bug is fixed
    raises=AttributeError
)
def test_add_iterator_invalid_function_error(self):
    # Test documents CORRECT expected behavior
    # Hazelbean currently has bug
    # When fixed, test auto-passes (XPASSED alert)
```

**Result:** CI passes (12 xfailed tests don't block) while tracking bugs

---

## 5. Current Issues & Solutions

### Known Bugs in Core Code (4 bugs, all in `project_flow.py`)

| **Bug** | **Affected Tests** | **Severity** | **Fix Complexity** |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Error handling in add_iterator() | 4 xfailed | Medium | Low (2 hours) |
| Error handling in add_task() | 2 xfailed | Medium | Low (1 hour) |
| task_names_defined tracking | 2 failing | Medium | Low (30 min) |
| Task attribute inheritance | 1 failing | Low | Low (30 min) |

**Total:** 9 tests affected, ~4 hours to fix all

### Infrastructure Issues (45 failing tests)

**Root Causes:**
1. **GDAL environment:** Vector operations failing (~20 tests)
2. **Test data paths:** Incomplete fixtures (~10 tests)
3. **Performance tests:** Structure changes need updates (13 tests)

**Impact:** With remaining fixes, could reach 90%+ pass rate

---

## 6. Recent Achievement: Performance Regression Detection

**Fixed October 3, 2025**

**Problem:** Baselines weren't persisting across CI runs  
**Solution:** GitHub Artifacts for baseline storage

```yaml
# How it works:
Main Branch:  Establish baseline → Upload artifact (90-day retention)
PR Branch:    Download baseline → Run tests → Block if >10% slower
Bootstrap:    No baseline? → Create new one → Continue
```

**Result:** Performance regression detection now fully operational

---

## 7. Metrics Summary

| **Metric** | **Current** | **Target** | **Status** |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Total Tests | 281 | 200+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| Overall Pass Rate | 76% | 80%+ | ⚠️ Close |
| Unit Pass Rate | 86% | 85%+ | ✅ Met |
| System Pass Rate | 100% | 100% | ✅ Met |
| Performance Regression | 10% threshold | Functional | ✅ Working |
| Known Bugs Tracked | 4 + infrastructure | <10 | ✅ Documented |

---

## 8. Next Steps

**Quick Wins (1-2 weeks):**
1. ~~Fix test data path configuration~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** (Oct 3) → +2 tests passing
2. Fix 4 bugs in `project_flow.py` → clears 9 tests
3. Fix GDAL environment → fixes ~20 tests
4. **Target:** 90%+ pass rate (currently 77%)

**Medium-term (1 month):**
1. Complete data dependency fixes
2. Update performance test expectations
3. **Target:** 95% pass rate

---
