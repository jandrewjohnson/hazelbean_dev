## Performance Characteristics

```{python}
import hazelbean as hb, tempfile, time

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    p = hb.ProjectFlow(project_dir=tmp)

    # Create a test file
    test_file = "performance_test.txt"
    with open(f"{tmp}/{test_file}", 'w') as f:
        f.write("test content")

    # Benchmark single call
    start = time.time()
    path = p.get_path(test_file)
    single_call_time = time.time() - start

    print(f"Single get_path call: {single_call_time:.6f} seconds")
    print(f"Resolved path: {path}")

    # Benchmark multiple calls
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(100):
        path = p.get_path(test_file)
    multiple_calls_time = time.time() - start

    print(f"100 get_path calls: {multiple_calls_time:.6f} seconds")
    print(f"Average per call: {multiple_calls_time/100:.6f} seconds")
```

This shows typical performance characteristics of the `get_path` method.
