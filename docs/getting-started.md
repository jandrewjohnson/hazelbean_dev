# Getting Started with Hazelbean

> **Complete setup guide for the Hazelbean geospatial processing library**

Welcome to Hazelbean! This guide will get you from zero to running geospatial analyses in about 15 minutes.

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ **Working Hazelbean environment** with all dependencies
- ✅ **Running examples** demonstrating core workflows  
- ✅ **Access to comprehensive documentation** for continued learning
- ✅ **Understanding of project structure** for your own work

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python experience:** Basic familiarity with Python programming
- **System requirements:** macOS, Windows, or Linux with conda/mamba
- **Time needed:** ~15 minutes for complete setup

## 🚀 Step 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)

### Option A: Complete Development Setup (Recommended)

**Best for:** Learning Hazelbean, contributing to the project, or accessing all features

```bash
# 1. Clone the complete repository
git clone https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/hazelbean_dev.git
cd hazelbean_dev

# 2. Create environment from configuration file
mamba env create -f environment.yml

# 3. Activate the environment
mamba activate hazelbean_env

# 4. Verify installation
python -c "import hazelbean as hb; print('✅ Hazelbean ready!')"
```

### Option B: Package Installation Only

**Best for:** Using Hazelbean in existing projects

```bash
# Install core dependencies
mamba install -c conda-forge natcap.invest geopandas pygeoprocessing taskgraph cython

# Install Hazelbean via pip
pip install hazelbean

# Verify installation  
python -c "import hazelbean as hb; print('✅ Hazelbean ready!')"
```

## 🧪 Step 2: Run Your First Example (5 minutes)

Test your installation with hands-on examples:

```bash
# Navigate to examples (Option A setup)
cd examples

# Run the first tutorial
python step_1_project_setup.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting Hazelbean Project Setup Tutorial
✅ ProjectFlow initialized successfully
✅ Directory structure created
🎉 Tutorial complete! Try step_2_data_loading.py next.
```

**If using Option B setup:** You can still run examples by creating the tutorial files manually or downloading them from the repository.

## 📚 Step 3: Explore Documentation (5 minutes)

### Local Documentation (Development Setup)

```bash
# Serve documentation locally
cd docs-site
mkdocs serve

# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 🗂️ Understanding Project Structure

After setup, you'll have access to:

```

```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### For New Users (Start Here)
1. **Complete setup** using Option A above
2. **Run all 5 tutorial examples** in `examples/` directory  
3. **Explore [Educational Journey](https://jandrewjohnson.github.io/hazelbean_dev/educational/)** online
4. **Try modifying examples** with your own data

### For Contributors  
1. **Complete development setup** (Option A)
2. **Review [Test Documentation](https://jandrewjohnson.github.io/hazelbean_dev/tests/)** to understand patterns
3. **Check [Live Reports](https://jandrewjohnson.github.io/hazelbean_dev/reports/)** for current system status
4. **Read contribution guidelines** in the repository

### For Power Users
1. **Explore test examples** in `hazelbean_tests/` for advanced patterns
2. **Review performance benchmarks** in `examples/baseline_management_demos/`
3. **Understand ProjectFlow architecture** through test documentation

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

### ProjectFlow System
Hazelbean organizes work using **ProjectFlow** - an intelligent task management system:

```python
import hazelbean as hb

# Initialize organized project
p = hb.ProjectFlow('my_analysis')

# Automatic directory structure:
# my_analysis/
# ├── inputs/      # Source data
# ├── intermediate/ # Processing files  
# └── outputs/     # Final results
```

### Intelligent Data Discovery
Find data across multiple locations automatically:

```python
# Smart file location - checks multiple directories
raster_path = p.get_path('land_cover.tif')

# Works with local files, cloud storage, or data repositories
```

### Efficient Processing
Memory-efficient operations with performance tracking:

```python
# Load and process raster data efficiently  
array = hb.arrayframe_to_array(raster_path)
result = hb.convolve_2d(array, kernel)
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Environment activated** (`conda activate hazelbean_env`)
- [ ] **Import working** (`import hazelbean as hb`)
- [ ] **Examples running** (at least `step_1_project_setup.py`)
- [ ] **Documentation accessible** (online or locally)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error: "No module named 'hazelbean'"**
```bash
# Ensure environment is activated
conda activate hazelbean_env

# Verify hazelbean is installed
pip list | grep hazelbean
```

**MkDocs Command Not Found**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the hazelbean_env environment
conda activate hazelbean_env
cd docs-site
mkdocs serve
```

**Examples Not Running**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the examples directory
cd examples

# Check that files exist
ls step_*.py

# Verify environment
python -c "import hazelbean; print('OK')"
```

**Missing Sample Data**
- Examples are designed to work with or without sample data
- Synthetic data will be generated if real data is missing
- This is normal and expected for first-time users
