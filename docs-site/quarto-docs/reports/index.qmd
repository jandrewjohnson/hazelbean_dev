- **Performance benchmarks** → Timing and efficiency analysis  
- **Code coverage tools** → Coverage percentage and gap analysis
- **Metrics data** → Baseline and benchmark tracking

### Manual Report Generation

To update all reports manually:

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/lucasralph/LJR_Projects/UMN/hazelbean_dev

# Generate all reports
python tools/generate_all_reports.py

# Render Quarto site
cd docs-site/quarto-docs
quarto render
```
