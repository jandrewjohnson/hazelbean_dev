## Step 1: Project Setup {#step-1-project-setup}

**Learning Time:** 5 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python knowledge  
**Difficulty:** Beginner

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
**By completing this step, you will:**

- Initialize a Hazelbean ProjectFlow for organized geospatial workflows
- Understand the intelligent directory structure that Hazelbean creates  
- Master the data discovery hierarchy and how get_path() searches for files
- Build the foundation for all subsequent Hazelbean projects
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Key Takeaway"}
**ProjectFlow** is the foundation of every Hazelbean workflow. It creates an organized directory structure and provides intelligent file path resolution that makes your analysis reproducible and professional. Think of it as your "project manager" that keeps everything organized automatically.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Real-World Application"}
In research and professional work, you'll often work with multiple datasets across different projects. ProjectFlow ensures that your analysis remains organized and reproducible, whether you're analyzing land cover changes, environmental impact assessments, or climate modeling.
:::

### Example Code

```python
"""
Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Management
Learn how to initialize a Hazelbean ProjectFlow for organized geospatial workflows.
"""

import os
import hazelbean as hb

def main():
    """
    Demonstrates ProjectFlow initialization and basic project organization.
    """
    
    # Create a new project with automatic directory structure
    project_name = 'hazelbean_tutorial'
    p = hb.ProjectFlow(project_name)
    
    print("=== Hazelbean Project Setup Demo ===")
    print(f"Project name: {project_name}")
    print(f"Project directory: {p.project_dir}")
    
    # ProjectFlow automatically creates these standard directories:
    print("=== Standard Project Directories ===")
    print(f"Input directory: {p.input_dir}")
    print(f"Intermediate directory: {p.intermediate_dir}")
    print(f"Output directory: {p.output_dir}")
    
    # Show data discovery paths
    print("=== Data Discovery Hierarchy ===")
    print("When you use p.get_path(), Hazelbean searches in this order:")
    print(f"1. Base data directory: {p.base_data_dir}")
    print(f"2. Model base data directory: {p.model_base_data_dir}")
    print(f"3. Project base data directory: {p.project_base_data_dir}")
    print(f"4. Current directory: {p.project_dir}")
    
    print("Project setup complete!")
    print("Next: Run step_2_data_loading.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 2: Data Loading {#step-2-data-loading}

**Learning Time:** 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed Step 1 (Project Setup)  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
**By completing this step, you will:**

- Master Hazelbean's intelligent file discovery system with get_path()
- Load and examine geospatial raster data efficiently
- Understand raster metadata and properties for analysis planning
- Handle missing data scenarios gracefully with fallback patterns
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Pro Insight"}
**get_path()** is Hazelbean's "smart search engine" for your files. It searches through multiple data directories automatically, following an intelligent hierarchy:

1. Project-specific directories first
2. Base data directories 
3. Model-wide data repositories
4. Current working directory as fallback

This means your code works whether data is local to your project, shared across projects, or in a centralized data repository.
:::

### Example Code

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Run the `step_2_data_loading.py` script from the `examples/` directory to explore data loading capabilities. The script demonstrates intelligent file discovery and raster metadata extraction.
:::

---

## Step 3: Processing {#step-3-processing}

**Learning Time:** 15 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed Steps 1-2 (Setup & Data Loading)  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
**By completing this step, you will:**

- Apply mathematical operations to raster data efficiently
- Perform coordinate transformations between spatial reference systems
- Create derived datasets through raster calculations
- Handle different data types and scaling factors appropriately
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Critical Concept"}
**Spatial Reference Systems (CRS)** are fundamental to geospatial analysis:

- **Always verify** your coordinate reference systems when combining datasets
- **Different CRS** can make data appear misaligned even when geographically correct
- **Hazelbean helps** with transformations, but understanding your data's spatial properties prevents analysis errors
- **Rule of thumb:** Match all datasets to the same CRS before analysis
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Technical Deep Dive"}
Raster processing involves working with **multi-dimensional arrays** where each cell represents a geographic location. Understanding data types (float32 vs int16), no-data values, and scaling factors ensures your mathematical operations produce meaningful results.
:::

### Example Code

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Run the `step_3_basic_processing.py` script from the `examples/` directory to learn about raster processing operations and coordinate transformations.
:::

---

## Step 4: Analysis {#step-4-analysis}

**Learning Time:** 20 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed Steps 1-3 (Setup, Data Loading, Basic Processing)  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
**By completing this step, you will:**

- Combine multiple raster datasets in sophisticated spatial analysis
- Perform zonal statistics and regional summaries for insights
- Create classification maps and derived analytical products
- Handle complex analytical workflows efficiently and reproducibly
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Real-World Applications"}
**This step demonstrates patterns you'll use for:**

- **Land Cover Analysis:** Classify land use types and track changes over time
- **Change Detection:** Compare datasets across different time periods  
- **Environmental Impact:** Assess how human activities affect natural systems
- **Regional Planning:** Analyze patterns within administrative or ecological boundaries
- **Resource Management:** Quantify natural resources within specific regions
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Analysis Philosophy"}
**Multi-raster operations** represent the core of spatial analysis. You're not just processing individual datasets, but discovering **relationships and patterns** that emerge when data sources are combined intelligently.
:::

### Example Code

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Run the `step_4_analysis.py` script from the `examples/` directory to explore advanced spatial analysis techniques including zonal statistics and multi-raster operations.
:::

## Step 5: Export Results {#step-5-export-results}

**Learning Time:** 15 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed Steps 1-4 (Complete analysis workflow)  
**Difficulty:** Beginner (concepts) / Advanced (best practices)

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
**By completing this step, you will:**

- Organize analysis outputs in professional directory structures
- Create comprehensive documentation and metadata for reproducibility
- Generate detailed analysis reports with clear summaries and insights
- Establish reproducible workflows for sharing and collaboration
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Professional Best Practice"}
**Documentation and organization** are just as important as the analysis itself. Well-organized results with clear documentation:

- **Enable collaboration** with colleagues and stakeholders
- **Ensure reproducibility** for future research and validation  
- **Facilitate peer review** and publication processes
- **Save time** when you return to a project months later
- **Build credibility** in professional and academic settings
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Career Impact"}
**Professional result organization distinguishes expert practitioners:**

- **Junior level:** Focuses on getting the analysis to work
- **Intermediate level:** Produces clean code and basic documentation  
- **Expert level:** Creates comprehensive, self-documenting workflows that others can build upon

This step teaches **expert-level practices** that make your work valuable beyond the immediate analysis.
:::

### Example Code

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Run the `step_5_export_results.py` script from the `examples/` directory to learn best practices for organizing and documenting your analysis results.
