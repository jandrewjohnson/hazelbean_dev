Consolidated Integration Tests for Parallel Processing Workflows

This file consolidates tests from:
- parallel_processing_workflows/test_pygeoprocessing.py

Covers parallel processing integration testing including:
- Basic parallel processing setup and configuration
- Integration with pygeoprocessing library
- Multi-threaded and multi-process workflow validation
- Resource management and cleanup
- Error handling in parallel environments
