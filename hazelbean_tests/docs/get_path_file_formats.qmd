## Supported File Formats

```{python}
import hazelbean as hb, tempfile, os

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    p = hb.ProjectFlow(project_dir=tmp)

    # Test different file extensions
    file_types = [
        "data.csv",
        "raster.tif", 
        "vector.shp",
        "config.json",
        "script.py",
        "document.txt"
    ]

    print("Testing file format resolution:")
    for file_type in file_types:
        path = p.get_path(file_type)
        print(f"  {file_type} -> {os.path.basename(path)}")
```

The `get_path` method works with various file formats commonly used
in geospatial and scientific computing workflows.
