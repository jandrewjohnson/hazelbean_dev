```{python}
import hazelbean as hb, tempfile, os
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    p = hb.ProjectFlow(project_dir=tmp)
    print(p.get_path("foo.txt"))
```

Above we create a throw-away project directory and ask Hazelbean for
`"foo.txt"`.  The printed path shows how *get_path* resolves files relative
to the project workspace.
